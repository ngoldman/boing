## About

This is a demonstration of using the [`EventListener.handleEvent()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventListener/handleEvent) method to create an interactive button component bound to an audio element.

First created March 2nd, 2014 for an inside joke when I worked at [Esri PDX](http://pdx.esri.com).
